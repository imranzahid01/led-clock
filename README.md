## Overview
A big thanks to Felix Hageloh for creating a widget platform Üebersicht
This widet shows hours and minutes in LED format. No external fonts were used, it is controlled by CSS.

The widget is small enough and sits right of the menu bar, so that it is easily visible on the main screen.

## Credits

Would not be possible without the platform:
